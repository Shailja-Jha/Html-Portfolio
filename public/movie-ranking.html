<h1>The Best Movies According To Shailja :)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr >
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>Quite ovious for this movie to be my top favourite because of how relatable and familiar things are with me as shown there.A great movie for all people specially of age in 20s and mind 20s.This is a movie full of life and shows the life of all types of engineers ..starting from those who are willing to chose this to those in pressure.It shows that how life is so much easy and fun to live if we are happy with what we love to do!! </p>
<h3>2 States</h3>
<p>If your genre includes romantic love stories with practicality which is relatable specially in Hindus then you must watch this.A peep into the story of Krish and Ananya 's love story or more precisely their marriage story and their struggles to tie the knot is heart melting. </p>
<h3>Conjuring</h3>
<p>This has to be last but definetly not the least movie which is a must watch if you are someone who likes the feeling of terror inside you.A great typical horror story but with an exceptional direction and story telling as well as as lots and lots of jump scares!!</p>
